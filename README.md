Dataset:

Lessons learnt:
Tricky to make Tableau results 'sexy' without any time/location data
Allow more time for cleaning data - I wanted to include indivudual player data, but the dataset I found was too messy and would've taken too long to clean.

Possible improvements:
Include individual player data
Compare top 50 performance with my own performance
